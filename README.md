# What the Kids are Listening To

## Overview
What the Kids are Listening To is a data visualization project that will help you to see what is trending and where. Taking advantage of the Last.FM API to gather information on top-streaming artists and tracks, you will soon be able to see exactly what it is that the kids are listening to after all.
